InstagramEmbed is an instagram link embedding program utilizing Open Graph Protocol to embed photos and videos on Discord and other OpenGPL supported platforms.

It utilizes SnapSave api to download files, as opposed to other instagram embedding solutions which use different methods. Snapsave api ensures that almost all content can be displayed, compared to only some with all the other solutions that I know of.
